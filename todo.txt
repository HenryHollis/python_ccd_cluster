WHAT IVE LEARNED/COMMON ERRORS
1. Make sure your in a Conda env that matches the architecture of your machine
2. Make try removing the builds in /build and running python setup.py install
3. Make sure '-g' is in the extra_compile_args in setup.py:
	extra_compile_args=['-std=c++11', '-g']
4. Now that I want lumpy functionality in c++, make sure:
    a. To include numpy.get_include() in include_dirs arg of setup.py
    B. That gives the full path of header <numpy/arrayobject.h>, which you need to include in cpp files
    C. Make sure you use import_array() in PyInit__c_leiden.
    D. sorting this out still: segfault error for numpy functionality in c++ goes away if you include pynterface.h in python_partition_interface.cpp



TODO:
Update docstring of ccdModularityVertexPartition in VertexPartition.py
